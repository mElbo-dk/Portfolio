          <p>I am trained as an electrician and have worked my way to Automation Engineer by doing programming of PLCâ€™s (machine controls systems). 
            
            This led me to work offshore on a high tech drillship for the last 5 years.
              The offshore working schedule is a bit different and normal calendars apps do not support this so I decided to make my own app. This was my inspiration to learn more about coding at General Assembly. I do feel strongly about solving practical problems and creating something people want to use and I have a good eye for simple ways to do things. I am looking for a role as junior full stack or mobile developer and would love to be able to keep learning in software development.</p>

          <h2 >Project 4</h2>
          <p >Project 4 was learning the Django framework at the same time as creating a RESTful API in a PostGresSQL database. This was a group project with 2 people, me on the backend with Django and PostGres and my mate on frontend with React. This was my first time as git master and first time with Django and python. The project was a cutdown version of a Document Control system to handle drawings uploaded to claudinary.

          <h2>Project 3</h2>
       <p>Project 3 was a group project, for one week, in React JS and the NoSQL database MongoDB. My role was mainly the backend creating the RESTful API to call from the frontend.  For the front part I did some forms for login, register and edit. I also took part in the styling that was done with CSS and Spectre CSS framework. Test for login was made with chai, mocha and supertest.
