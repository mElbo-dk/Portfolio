      <h2 class="title">Junior Software Engineering</h2>
      <p class="brand">
        I am trained as an electrician and have worked my way to Automation Engineer by doing programming of PLCâ€™s (machine controls systems). 
        This led me to work offshore on a high tech drillship for the last 5 years.
        The offshore working schedule is a bit different and normal calendars apps do not support this so I decided to make my own app. This was my inspiration to learn more about coding at General Assembly. I do feel strongly about solving practical problems and creating something people want to use and I have a good eye for simple ways to do things. I am looking for a role as junior full stack or mobile developer and would love to be able to keep learning in software development.
